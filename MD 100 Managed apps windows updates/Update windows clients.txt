Knowledge Check

1. Which of the following items identifies the four phases in the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) update management process? 
A. Identify, Evaluate and plan, Deploy, Support
B. Assess, Evaluate and plan, Identify, Deploy
C. Assess, Identify, Evaluate and plan, Deploy

Ans A =  The goal of the assess phase is to set up a production environment that supports update management for routine and emergency scenarios. During the identify phase, you identify new updates that are available, and determine whether they are relevant to your organization. After you identify the relevant updates, you need to evaluate whether they work properly in your environment. After you have thoroughly tested an update and determined any dependencies, you can approve it for deployment in the production network.

2. As the Desktop Administrator for World Wide Importers, Alan Deyoung wants to configure each individual computer with specific Windows Update settings. Doing this manually would be very time consuming, so Alan plans to create a Group Policy Object (GPO) to configure the necessary settings. After creating the GPO, what must Alan use to apply those settings to the appropriate collection of computers? 
A. Active Directory Domain Services
B. Configuration Manager
C. Microsoft Endpoint Manager

Ans A =  To configure each individual computer with specific Windows Update settings would be very time-consuming. Fortunately, you can create a Group Policy Object (GPO) to configure the necessary settings, and then use Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to apply those settings to the appropriate collection of computers.

3. As the Desktop Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to use Windows Update for Business to manage which Windows Updates are received when, as well as the experience a device has when it receives them. Holly wants to specify which devices go first in an update wave, and which ones will come later. This design will help Holly ensure that all quality bars are met. What must Holly do to support this update plan? 
A. Implement peer-to-peer delivery for Microsoft updates
B. Integrate Windows Update for Business with Microsoft Intune
C. Create deployment rings

Ans C = Deployment rings enable administrators to specify which devices go first in an update wave, and which ones will come later (to ensure any quality bars are met).

4. As the Windows Update for Business administrator at Contoso, you want to defer the installation of both feature and quality updates from deploying to devices within a bounded range of time from when those updates are first made available on the Windows Update service. You want to use this deferral to allow time to validate deployments as they are pushed to devices. What's the maximum deferral period for quality updates? 
A. 30 days
B. 180 days
C. 365 days

Ans A = The maximum deferral period for quality updates is 30 days. The maximum deferral period for feature updates is 365 days.

5. Your organization requires that updates are controlled and deferred. You want to utilize the service updates with Windows. Which servicing tool will allow you to perform centralized management using Group Policy or Microsoft Intune? 
A. Windows Update
B. Windows Update for Business
C. Windows Server Update Service

Ans B = You can use Group Policy or MDM solutions such as Intune to configure the Windows Update for Business settings that control how and when Windows devices are updated. In addition, by using Intune, organizations can manage devices that are not joined to a domain at all or are joined to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) alongside your on-premises domain-joined machines.
