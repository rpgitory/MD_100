Configure IP network connectivity

- Explore windows network configuration
From wifi or Ethernet 
	: Change advanced sharing options - configure network discovery, file and print sharing, public folder sharing, media sharing options and encyrption used in these all.
	: Launch the network and sharing option - configure most network settings
	: Configure windows firewall - configure windows firewall rules
From within wifi 
	: View available networks
	: View hardware properties
	: Managed known networks 
	: Configure hotspot 2.0 network

- Explore IPv4 settings
	: In conjunction with a subnet mask, the address identifies
		- The computer's unique identity, which is the HOST ID
		- The subnet on whcih the computer resides, which is the network ID

Define subnet from IPv4 networks
Explain public and private IP addressing 
	
- DHCP 
	: Include resilience in your DHCP service design so that the failure of a single server does not prevent the service from functioning.
	: Configure DHCP server carefully. If you made mistack it can affect the whole network.

Examine tools for configuring network settings

Note :- Functionality in the Windows PowerShell network-related cmdlets has largely replaced Netsh.

- windows disgonose tools for network problems

	: Event Viewer
	: Windows network disgnostics 
	: IPConfig
	: Ping
	: Tracert
	: NSLookup	
	: Pathping
	: Windows PowerShell

- Event Viewer
	: windows records the event in an appropiate event log
	: Event viewer can access the application security, setup, and system logs under the system logs the windows logs node.
	
- Windows network diagnostics 
	: it presents a possible description of the problem and potential remedy.
	
IPConfig
	: Display current TCP/IP network configuration
	: IPConfig can use to refresh DHCP, and DNS settings. 
	
command			Description
ipconfig /all 		View detailed configuration information.
ipconfig /release	Release the leased configuration back to the DHCP server.	
ipconfig /renew 	Renew the leased configuration.
ipconfig /displaydns 	View the DNS resolve cache.
ipconfig /flushdns 	Purge the DNS resolve cache.
ipconfig /registerdns 	Register/update the client's host name with the DNS server.

Ping
	: It verify the ip level connectivity to another TCP/IP computer.	
	: It sends and receive the ICMP (internet Control Message Protocol) packets.
	
Note :- Firewalls might block the ICMP requests. As a result, you might receive false negatives when using Ping as a troubleshooting tool.

Tracert 
	: It determines the path taken to a destination computer by sending ICMP echo requests. 
	: This tool also determines which router has failed, and what the latency, or speed, is.
	: These results might not be accurate if the router is busy, because the router will assign the packets a low priority.

Pathping
	: Quite same as Tracert however Pathping provides more detailed statistics on the individual steps, or hops, through the network.
	: The command can provide greater detail because it sends 100 packets for each router, which enables it to establish trends.
