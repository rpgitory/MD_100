Explore Name Resolution

computer names
	: NetBIOS name is a nonhierachical name that some older apps use.			
	: NetBIOS can represents a single computer or a group of computers.
	: NetBIOS first 15 characters used for specified computer's name and final sixteenth character to identify a resource or service on that computer. Ex  NYC-SVR2[20h].


Methods for resolving names
	: locate domain controller and global catalog servers 
	: Resolve IP addresses to host names
	: Locate a mail server for email delivery 
Note :- If NetBIOS over TCP/IP is enabled, TCP/IP also uses NetBIOS name resolution methods when resolving single-label, unqualified host names.

- Depending on the configuration, Windows resolves host names by performing the following actions:
 	: checking by whether the hostname is the same as local host name.
	: Searching the DNS resolver cache which is populated from the local hosts file.
	: Sending a DNS request to its configured DNS servers.
Note :- Windows can use Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution for networks that do not have a DNS server.
